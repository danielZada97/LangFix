# LangFix
 a chrome extension that fixes the language of a misstyped text
 how many times ,you started to write something for ChatGPT, GMAIL. Facebook Youtube or any other site*, then realized that you are not writing on the language that you intended to?
 personally, as a software engineer who frequently writes both in hebrew and english, this happened alot of times.

for this i spent a weekend tocreate a fix for this problem, and i present to you:
LangFix, the first ever langauge text converter on a click that will save you lots of time and frustrations that occurs when you write a lg paragraph and have to rewrite it since you didntuse the correct language.
this chorme extension adds an option on the context menu (right click) that allows you to change the language.

how does this work?
first you need to highlight the text you want to correct:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6a0f58f-f949-4656-969a-4dd4507eb8cc)

then you right click on your mouse:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/676bc583-63cd-4cf7-a308-ed8009577366)
click on "Correct Text"
and viola! the text will be corrected!
